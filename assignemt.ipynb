    "#ASSIGNMENT\n",
    "#Q1.. WhAT IS AN EXCEPTION IN PYTHON?WRITE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXCEPTIONS AND SYNTAX ERROR?\n",
    "#In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to handle errors and unexpected situations in a more controlled manner. They allow you to gracefully deal with problems that might otherwise cause your program to crash.\n",
    "#Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "#Exception:\n",
    "#Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when a specific error condition is encountered.\n",
    "#They are raised by the Python interpreter or by the code you write using the raise statement.\n",
    "#Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, and custom exceptions you define in your code.\n",
    "#You can catch and handle exceptions using try and except blocks to prevent the program from crashing and to perform error-specific actions.\n",
    "#Syntax Error:\n",
    "#Syntax errors occur during the parsing of your code, before it is executed. They are also known as parsing errors.\n",
    "#They are caused by violations of the language's syntax rules, such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "#Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all. The code must be fixed before it can be executed.\n",
    "#Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, incorrect variable names, and improper indentation.\n",
    "#Q2.WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN EXCEPTION IS NOT HANDLED?EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE?\n",
    "#ANS-When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it leads to an abnormal termination of the program. In such a case, Python prints an error message, known as a traceback, to the console, indicating the type of exception that occurred and the location in the code where it occurred. This traceback provides information about the call stack and the sequence of function calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "#def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    #return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    #result = divide(10, 0)  # Attempt to divide by zero\n",
    "   # print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "#except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "   # print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "    #In this example, we have a divide function that attempts to divide a number by another number. However, in the try block, we are attempting to divide by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics and will raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n",
    "#Q3.WHICH PYTHON STATEMENTS ARE USED TO CATCH AND HANDLE EXCEPTIONS?EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE?\n",
    "#In Python, you can use the try and except statements to handle exceptions. The try block is used to enclose the code where an exception might occur, and the except block is used to specify how to handle the exception if it occurs. Here's an explanation with an example:\n",
    "#try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   # result = 10 / 0  # Attempting to divide by zero\n",
    "#except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "   # print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "#In this example, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The try block, which contains the code that might raise an exception. In this case, we are attempting to divide the number 10 by zero, which will raise a ZeroDivisionError.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The except block, which specifies how to handle the exception. Here, we catch the ZeroDivisionError and assign it to the variable e. Then, we print an error message along with the exception message.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you run this code, here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The program enters the try block and executes the code within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# An exception is raised because we cannot divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since we have an except block that specifically handles ZeroDivisionError, Python jumps to that block.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the except block, we print an error message along with the exception message (which contains information about the error).\n",
    "\n",
    "# The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "# vbnet\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# An error occurred: division by zero\n",
    "# This demonstrates how the try and except statements work together to catch and handle exceptions. You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions or a general except block to catch any unexpected exceptions. Additionally, you can use the else and finally blocks in combination with try and except to further control the flow of your exception handling code.\n",

    "#Q4.EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE\n",
    "#TRY AND ELSE\n",
    "#FINALLY\n",
    "#RAISE\n",
    "#Certainly! Let's explain the use of try, except, else, and finally blocks in Python with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# try:\n",
    "#     # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "#     result = 10 / 2  # This division should succeed\n",

    "#     print(\"No exceptions occurred. Result:\", result)\n",
    "# finally:\n",
    "#     # Code to run regardless of whether an exception occurred\n",
    "#     print(\"Finally block executed.\")\n",
    "# In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The try block contains code that performs a division operation, which should succeed without raising any exceptions since we are dividing by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The except block specifies what to do if a ZeroDivisionError exception occurs. However, since we are not dividing by zero in this case, this block will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The else block contains code that will run if no exceptions occur within the try block. In this case, it prints a message along with the result of the division.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The finally block contains code that will run regardless of whether an exception occurred. It is used for cleanup or resource release tasks. In this example, it simply prints a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you run this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The program enters the try block and successfully calculates the result of 10 / 2, which is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since no exceptions occurred, the except block is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The program enters the else block and prints the message \"No exceptions occurred. Result: 5\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finally, the program enters the finally block and prints \"Finally block executed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "# rust\n",
    "# No exceptions occurred. Result: 5\n",
    "# Finally block executed.\n",
    "# This example demonstrates how you can use the try, except, else, and finally blocks together to handle exceptions gracefully while ensuring that certain code (such as cleanup operations) always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",

    "#Q5.what are custom exceptions in python?why do we need custom exceptions ?explain with an example?\n",
    "#ansCustom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that you define in your Python code to handle specific error conditions that are not adequately represented by the built-in exceptions provided by Python. These exceptions allow you to create more expressive and meaningful error handling in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's why you might need custom exceptions and an example to illustrate their use:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why do we need Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expressiveness: Custom exceptions allow you to create exceptions with names that describe the specific error condition more accurately, making your code more readable and self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modularity: They help in modularizing error handling code. Instead of scattering error handling logic throughout your codebase, you can centralize it within custom exception classes, making your code easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Granularity: Custom exceptions can be designed to represent different error scenarios within your application, providing a finer level of control over how different errors are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction: You can encapsulate details of error handling and provide a higher-level interface for error management, making your code more abstract and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suppose you're building a banking application, and you want to handle the scenario where a user tries to withdraw more money from their account than they have available. You could define a custom exception for this situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):\n",
    "#     \"\"\"Custom exception for insufficient funds.\"\"\"\n",
    "#     def __init__(self, balance, amount):\n",
    "#         self.balance = balance\n",
    "#         self.amount = amount\n",
    "#         super().__init__(f\"Insufficient funds: Balance is {balance}, but attempted to withdraw {amount}\")\n",
    "# Now, you can use this custom exception in your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# def withdraw(account_balance, amount):\n",
    "#     if account_balance < amount:\n",
    "#         raise InsufficientFundsError(account_balance, amount)\n",
    "#     else:\n",
    "#         # Perform the withdrawal\n",
    "#         account_balance -= amount\n",
    "#         return account_balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# try:\n",
    "#     balance = 100\n",
    "#     amount_to_withdraw = 150\n",
    "#     new_balance = withdraw(balance, amount_to_withdraw)\n",
    "#     print(f\"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {new_balance}\")\n",
    "# except InsufficientFundsError as e:\n",
    "#     print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "# In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# We define a custom exception InsufficientFundsError, which inherits from the base Exception class. This exception takes the current balance and the withdrawal amount as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the withdraw function, if the withdrawal amount exceeds the account balance, we raise the InsufficientFundsError with an informative error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the try block, we attempt a withdrawal and handle the custom exception if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using custom exceptions in this way allows you to create a more structured and informative error-handling mechanism tailored to the specific needs of your application.\n",
    "#q6.create a custom exception class use this class to handle an exception?\n",
    "#To create a custom exception class in Python, you can define a new class that inherits from the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses (e.g., ValueError, TypeError, or RuntimeError).
